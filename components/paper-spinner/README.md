paper-spinner
=============

Experimental element for a circular spinner. Use at your own risk -
we're looking into eventually rolling this in to the paper-* element set
but expect lots of changes: this won't be officially supported while still 
part of PolymerLabs/.

Known issues:
- Not cross-browser compatible
- Some performance problems
